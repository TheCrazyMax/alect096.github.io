# None Shall Pass!!! (Forensics - 150 pts)

> Your job is to identify how to open the file, bypass itâ€™s security control(s), and find the flag. Knowledge of security is not mandatory, but having some knowledge about programming concepts or languages will help. If you have a love for chitchat or lighthouses, you will have an extra edge.


For this challenge we received two files. The first one was [chitchat.image](chitchat.image) and the second one was [chitchat.changes](chitchat.changes).

the first thing we did was to make a `binwalk` on the image file, we then made a `cat` of it and finally executed the `strings` command on it before trying to mount it. 

we knew from the statement that the flag format of this challenge was CSC<STRINGS>

> ```sh
> strings chitchat.image | grep "CSC"
>	CSCBALLOON216767349
