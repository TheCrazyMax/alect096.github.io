  <p>A chaotic admin set up an FTP challenge but might have misplaced some files. 
63.35.125.97:21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We firstly logged in as anonymous without a password. We were able to access to some files and folders. </p>

<p>In those files we found a lot of pictures of cats, <a href="kublaiBADPASSWORDS.list">lists of words</a> and a <a href="users.list">list of users</a>.
On the other hand we had a folder with subfolders representing the users. In the admin folder we found a <a href="README.txt">README.txt</a>, here is the content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>
Please don't abuse this server! This FTP server is used to share my favourite cats (there's only one thing I like more than cats). Feel free to browse through them and download your favourites. If you want to add your own cats shoot me a mail (darthcatlover9001@sharklasers.com) and I'll give you a user account. The cats you add will then appear in the /users/username/public folder.
If you're into lists instead of cats you might also like my other FTP server. I sometimes get confused so if I misplaced a list on this server please let me know.

<p>And a <a href="thanksto.tx">thanksto.txt</a> containing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>
Thanks to:
-Maxogden (for helping me start my collection)
-Charlottd
-Charlottf
-Dennis
</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to the list, we thought about launching a dictionary attack on the FTP service to try to log in with the admin account. </p>

<p>We decided to use Hydra to perform this action.</p>

<p>We are now able to log in with the admin account and the password cookies.</p>

<p>On this account we found a a file in the following path <a href="flag.txt">/admin/flag.txt</a>: <code>CSC{I'm_a_flag-da-be-die-dabe-flag!}</code></p>
