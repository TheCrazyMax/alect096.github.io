For this challenge, we were given a sheet of paper with some cryptograms :

We knew a few of these but not most of them so we went to [dCode.fr](http://www.dcode.fr) to find the missing substitution alphabets.

Here is the list of all alphabets in this text by order of appearance :

* Flag Semaphore :

* Maritime Signals Code :

* Templar Cipher :

* Braille Alphabet :

* Sheikah Language :

* Pigpen Cipher :

* Klingon Language :

* Dancing Man Cipher :

Once everything was decoded we could read (with added spaces) :

```
THE FLAG IS THE NAME OF THE RAINBOW CAT CONCATENATED WITH THE SECOND PART OF THE SURPRISED POKEMON
```

The rainbow cat is the `nyan` cat :

And the surprised pokemon had to be Pikachu :

So the flag was :

```
nyanchu
```

DONE
